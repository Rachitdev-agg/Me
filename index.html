        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p class="writing-des">I have always been really into reading. When I was a kid and couldn't read, I would make my parents reads story books to me. After some time I learnt how to read myself and discovered a whole world of fiction and fantasy. Then as I was reading harry potter for the 10th time, I thought that I should write as well. And after many failed attempts at writing, I have finnaly found my style. Its aesthetic writing. I dont even know if thats a real type of writing but its just what I call it. And now I sometimes write when I am too full of feelings. Writing has become a way for me to release my feelings and exposing them to people without really exposing them to people.</p>

        <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
        <p class="guitar-des">I don't exactly know how to play guitar, instead right now, I am learning to play guitar and I think I will know how to do so in the near future and this serves as motivation to achieve that, thats why I have listed it as a skill. I have tried many times before to learn it but gave up, I think this time's the charm. Recently things haven't been going so well and playing the guitar has helped me through that and thus, I have developed a little love for it. I soon hope to master this skill and show it off to everyone I know.</p>
